<h2>🔍 About Me</h2>

<p>
  <strong>Hello, I'm Jonathan Barreneche!</strong> but you can call me <strong>jbar</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  As a <em>Cloud Engineer</em> with a security focus, I'm certified in both <strong>AWS</strong>, <strong>Azure</strong>, and <strong>Sec+</strong>. I'm not just about the cloud, though; I'm also fascinated by the potential of <strong>AI</strong>, and I'm excited about the promise of <strong>Web3</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  When I'm not architecting secure digital infrastructures, you can catch me cheering on the Lakers in basketball 🏀, going on epic road trips 🚗, or exploring endless amounts of recipes for my Instapot🍲.
</p>

  I always want to learn and collaborate, so please connect and message me on Linkedin. &#11015;
